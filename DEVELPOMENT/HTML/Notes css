What is CSS?
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control the look and layout of web pages written in HTML. With CSS, you can change colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, layouts, animations, and responsiveness—without touching the HTML structure.

Why CSS is Important
    Separates design from content
    Makes websites beautiful and consistent
    Helps build responsive pages (mobile, tablet, desktop)
    Reduces repeated code
    Improves page loading and maintenance

Types of CSS : - CSS can be applied to HTML in three main ways:
1️⃣ Inline CSS
    CSS is written inside the HTML tag using the style attribute.
    Affects only one element.
example:
    <p style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">Hello World</p>
Advantages:
    Quick testing
    Highest priority
Disadvantages:
    Not reusable
    Makes HTML messy
    Hard to maintain
✅ Use only for small or temporary changes

2️⃣ Internal CSS
    CSS is written inside the <style> tag in the <head> section.
    Applies to one HTML page.
Example:
    <head>
        <style>
            p {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 18px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
Advantages:
    Better than inline CSS
    Useful for single-page styling
Disadvantages:
    Not reusable across multiple pages
✅ Good for single-page websites or testing layouts

3️⃣ External CSS (Most Recommended)
    CSS is written in a separate .css file
    Linked to HTML using <link>
Example:
    HTML~ <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    CSS~ p{
            color: green;
            font-size: 16px;
        }

Advantages:
    Clean HTML
    Reusable across many pages
    Easy maintenance
    Faster loading (browser caching)
Disadvantages:
    Requires extra file
✅ Best practice for real websites and projects

CSS Priority Order (Important)
    If multiple CSS types are applied:
        Inline CSS > Internal CSS > External CSS
